# The sector_width, sector_height, subsector_width, subsector_height tell the game the number of subectors in the game, as well as how big each subsector is.
# A 4x4 subsector means that there are only 16 spots in it for stars, planets, and ships - pretty cramped! Sinilarly, if the sector_width is 3 and the 
# sector_height is 5, then that means there are 15 sub sectors in the sector.

# Because each subsector must display information such as how many stars it contains, the number of friendly, unfriendy/unhabited/primitive planets, and the 
# number of allied and enemy ships, each cell in the dsiplay is going to be a lot bigger.   
# This is what a display with a 2x2 sector width would look like

# If the width of a sector is 4, and the height is 4, then the width in characters will be 1 + 5 * 4 = 21 and the height will be 1 + 4 * 4 = 17. 
# If width is 8, and the height is 8, then the width in characters will be 1 + 5 * 8 = 41, and the height will be 1 + 4 * 8 = 33.
